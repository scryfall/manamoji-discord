Discord emojis for _Magic: the Gathering_ card symbols.

These symbols are designed for use with [Scryfall’s Discord bot](https://scryfall.com/bots), but they are **not required**. Scryfall’s bot hosts its own emoji files.

### Installation

1. [Download this project](https://github.com/scryfall/manamoji-discord/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) as a ZIP file.
2. In Discord, go to Sever Settings → Emoji.
3. Drag any of the emoji files in the `emojis` folder or `extras` folder that you want into the Discord window. (We don’t recomend using the `extras`, as they are either funny or very rare symbols)
4. Done!
